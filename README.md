1. what is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack, production-ready web applications.

    It uses React for creating user interfaces.

    It provides additional built-in features that make development faster and easier.

    Unlike plain React (where you install extra packages for routing, SSR, etc.), Next.js includes everything you need out of the box.

    These features include routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, bundling, compiling and more

    No need to install additional packages as Next.js provides everything you need

2. why learn Next.js?

Next.js simplifies the process of building production-ready applications.

    - Simplified Routing → File-based routing, no need for external libraries like react-router-dom.

    - API Routes → Create backend endpoints directly inside your app without needing Express or another server.

    - Flexible Rendering → Supports multiple rendering strategies:

        - Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

        - Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

        - Static Site Generation (SSG)

        - Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

    - Data Fetching → Built-in functions (getStaticProps, getServerSideProps, getStaticPaths, and React Server Components) make fetching data simple and efficient.

    - Styling Options → Supports CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, Styled JSX, Sass, and other styling libraries.

    - Performance Optimization → Automatic code-splitting, image optimization, caching, and fast refresh.

    - Seamless Dev & Prod Builds → Easy development environment with Hot Reloading, and optimized production builds with bundling, minification, and tree-shaking.
